# hurricane-irma

Code for the [Hurricane Irma visualiztion](https://owi.usgs.gov/vizlab/hurricane-irma/).

Initial Setup:

Clone this repository.

Open the included `hurricane-irma.Rproj`

If you don't have it, install [`vizlab`](https://github.com/USGS-VIZLAB/vizlab)

Check to make sure you have required packages listed in `viz.yaml` installed. To get the `svglite` package, you will need to install it from GitHub using `devtools::install_github("jread-usgs/svglite@svgnano")`. For Windows users, you might see an error similar to `Error: running command '"C:/PROGRA~1/R/R-34~1.1/bin/x64/R" --no-site-file --no-environ --no-save --no-restore --quiet CMD config CC' had status 127`. If this is the case, clone [Jordan Read's repository](https://github.com/jread-usgs/svglite) and build the package locally on the branch `svgnano`.

do:
```r
library(vizlab)
createProfile()
createMakefiles()
```

then make sure you have the proper packages and versions installed with:
```r
vizlab::checkVizPackages()
```
and use `install.packages()` or `devtools::install_github()` to update

`createProfile()` may not be necessary if you've worked on vizlab before.

Go to the "build" tab in Rstudio. You should see a "Build All" option. Click it!

If there are errors, logs with errors are in `.hurricane-irma/vizlab/make/log`

Once you are able to complete the build, open `target/index.html` to see the finished product locally.
